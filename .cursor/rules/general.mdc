# Project description

This repo contains code for various laboratory assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course of the Technical University of Moldova.

Each directory is a separate assignment, with its own README.md file describing the task.

Before starting on a user request, read the corresponding README.md file for context.

## General Instructions

- Aim for the highest grade and structure your work accordingly.
- Use clear, modular code without comments or docstrings. Respect clean code principles, SOLID principles, and design patterns.
- Focus on clarity and maintainability, avoid over-engineering but ensure the code is well-structured.
- Make the code easy to read and easy to present to a professor when asked.
- Think hard before implementing a class. The user requests are often simple and do not require complex abstractions. Focus on accomplishing a single task well at a time.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Use `pydantic` to create DTOs.
- Follow a domain-driven, layered architecture
- Follow clean code practices, SOLID, YAGNI, KISS, DRY principles.

### Technical preferences

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use type hints for function signatures and variable declarations.
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting.
- Write classes when it is necessary to encapsulate related data and behavior.
- Use functions only for small, reusable pieces of logic that do not require maintaining state.
- Avoid comments that explain what the code does; instead, write self-explanatory code. Use comments to explain why certain decisions were made. Comments in general are discouraged.
- Docstrings are not needed for trivial functions, but should be used for complex functions and classes.

### Architecture

Each module has to be grouped by its domain and can have the following layers.

- `service.py` - service class that handles the business logic directly
- `repository.py` - repository class that handles accessing stored data
- `model.py` - file that contains any custom data model we may use for the services and the repo
- `schema.py` - file that contains usually DTOs for service-to-service communcation and clear method argument passing
- `utils.py` - file that contains any kind of utility methods and static functions that are related ot the domain
- `resources.py` - file that contains any static assets for the domain
- `dependencies.py` - file that contains and wires all the dependant services together.
- `error.py` - contains any domain errors, like `ThingNotFoundError` or `ThingUnavailableError`
